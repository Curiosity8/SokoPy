Update 24th June 2015

I found that my freeze deadlock detection is not working as expected, so I've commented that portion out when solving.
I also found that zobrist hashing is not working as expected - so I hashed it the "Python" way.

As you can see - there's not much change; but its giving me a great improvement.

Things to add:
1) Add tunnels
2) I need to correct my Freeze Deadlock module. And also add other types of deadlock detections....
