Update 24th June 2015

I found that there is an error in my freeze deadlock detection - so I'm not using it in the updated version.
I also found zobrist hashing is not working as expected - so I've hashed it the "Python" way. 
Now it works really well - giving a huge improvement!


Things to do:
1) Add tunnel detection
2) Correct the freeze deadlock detection, and add other deadlock detection as well.
